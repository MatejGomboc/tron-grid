### 2026-03-28 — Phase 5 complete: RT hard shadows

Acceleration structures (BLAS/TLAS) and inline ray query shadows via
VK_KHR_ray_query in the fragment shader (PR #71). Point light with
inverse square falloff and Lambertian diffuse. Key lessons: read vertex
normals from buffer (meshlet builder reorders winding), use
RAY_FLAG_CULL_BACK_FACING_TRIANGLES to prevent self-intersection,
light must be above max terrain height. 71 PRs merged.

### 2026-03-28 — Phase 4 complete: procedural Tron terrain

Barycentric wireframe rendering in mesh shader (PR #66), procedural terrain
generator with value noise heightmap and quantised heights (PR #68). Replaced
cube/sphere test scene with single terrain entity. Fixed Y-flip (removed manual
matrix negation, kept -fvk-invert-y). Codebase-wide {} brace initialisation,
include order fixes, struct member init. Meshlet triangles reduced from 124 to
84 for barycentric vertex duplication. CodeQL overflow fix. 68 PRs merged.

### 2026-03-28 — Phase 3 complete: mesh shaders + scene architecture

Entity/component scene (SoA), meshlet generation, mesh shader pipeline
(VK_EXT_mesh_shader: task + mesh + fragment), mixed cube/sphere scene with
per-object meshlet routing, LOD data structures, UV sphere generator.
13 code audit fixes. Logger deadlock fixed (std::jthread). 63 PRs merged.

### 2026-03-22 — Phases 0-2.1 complete

Phase 0 (triangle), Phase 1 (fly through cubes), Phase 2 (GPU-driven, 1000 cubes,
compute frustum culling, IndirectCount, GPU timestamps), Phase 2.1 (Clang-Tidy,
spirv-val, -Werror, sanitisers, GPU validation, 4 sync bugs fixed). 59 PRs merged.
